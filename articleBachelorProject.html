                        In this project we developed a Horror Game at the University of Bremen 
                        in Unreal Engine 4. We learned several things about Game Development 
                        and working efficiently as a team.
                        I in particular was responsible for the modelling of several assets in a 
                        software called Blender. One example was a fully rigged crow that was used 
                        as a scare-element in the game. Furthermore I also implemented most of <thead>
                        animations of the game by using the Unreal Animation tool.
                        </thead>
