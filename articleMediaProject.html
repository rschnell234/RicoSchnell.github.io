                        In the module Media Project my team and I also developed a 
                        video game in Unreal Engine 4. We learned many things about sound, 3D and game design in 
                        our development.
                        Furthermore this project taught us more about 
                        time management and how much time has to be invested in a project like a game.
                        Especially apparent was that you tend to have high standards for your first "programmed" game
                        and therefore we were too ambitious.
